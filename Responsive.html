  								<h1>ZOMBIE SURVIVAL 101</h1>
  								<h2>Becareful Not To Get Bitten!</h2>
  							</hgroup>
  								<p>To be honest I am not much of a expert on surviving a zombie attack, let alone make a website called zombie survival 101.  What
  								I do know is what I have learned from watching movies such as Zombieland, Resident Evil, Dawn of the Dead, Shaun of the Dead and many others.  
  								I will be quoting and using alot of what I seen in Zombieland movie.  If you havnt seen Zombieland I urge you to watch it, if you want to stay alive that is.  
  								The rules below have come from the movie, very helpful so I hope you remember them.</p>
  								<p>Again I appologize for not having the complete list, the movie didn't really give out all the rules.  We will just have to improvise and come up with our own
								rules to fill the gaps.  Basic things I know I would want to have is a lot of bottled water, canned food, a can opener of course, a spoon,
								rice and rice cooker yes I am asian.  If you find yourself having to defend againist some zombies and you don't have any type of firearms, I suggest investing
								in some items laying around.  My weapon of choice would be anything I can get my hands on, rocks, a bat, metal pipes something that dont need
								reloading.  My last piece of advice would be to stay close to people you trust, hide somewhere high and have things to pass the time by when you are not out running
								for your life. </p>
